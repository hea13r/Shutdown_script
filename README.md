# Shutdown_script

Basically just enter IPs you control in the ipList variable and it will go through checking what is active and then attempt to shut everything down, including whatever you run it from.

You just need to add a few IPs.

Also, this assumes a trusted relationship to the IP you are attempting to shutdown using certificates instead of username:password
